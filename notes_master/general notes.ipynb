      "##Introduction\n",
      "Identifying objects of interest is a key requirement for every robot.\n",
      "While navigating through an uncontrolled environment a robot has to avoid\n",
      "potential obstacles such as pedestrians or cars on the road. Localization\n",
      "and mapping tasks (SLAM) require to track landmarks in order to estimate\n",
      "the relative sensor position. For manipulation one has to know about what\n",
      "and how objects can be manipulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all these tasks motion is either the mandatory element or\n",
      "they can benefit from it. For example, showing the robot that a drawer\n",
      "can be opened or a mug can be moved from the table yields valuable\n",
      "information for many manipulation tasks. In fact the importance of motion for perception\n",
      "systems has been subject to lots of research and originates from the\n",
      "*Principles of Gestalt Psychology* by Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Kohler\n",
      "and Kurt Koffka \\cite{Koffka_1935}. In particular the *common fate* principle\n",
      "states that elements are perceived as grouped together, if they move\n",
      "along a common and smooth path. This principle has been applied to various\n",
      "computer vision problems such as image segmentation \\cite{Ochs_Brox_2011},\n",
      "\\cite{Kenney_Buckley_Brock_2009}, object recognition (CITE) or estimation\n",
      "of kinematic models \\cite{Martin_Brock_2014} .\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to exploit the information from motion one has to address certain\n",
      "difficulties. Typically measurements not only consists of data about\n",
      "the moving objects, but also of the image background or clutter measurements.\n",
      "Therefore dealing with sensor noise and background separation is an essential\n",
      "requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having the luxury to know the number of objects a priori is rarely the case\n",
      "in general tracking situations. So one not only has to estimate the number\n",
      "of objects in the scene but also handle cases when objects enter or leave\n",
      "the scene (usually refered to as object **birth** and **death**)\n",
      "or when objects are occluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dealing with multiple objects also requires to solve the data association\n",
      "or correspondence problem. This means to associate each measurement to a\n",
      "certain object. Early methods of multiple object tracking, when sensors\n",
      "like radar or laser scanner did not provide high resolutions, it was possible\n",
      "to resrict the association problem to one measurment per object. With increased \n",
      "resolution of modern sensor technology however,\n",
      "this is not always applicable and leads to the\n",
      "relaxed definition of **extended object** tracking.\n",
      "This means that objects are not treated as point sources anymore but instead\n",
      "feature a certain spatial extension that may cause multiple measurements per\n",
      "object.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of this thesis is to develop a general perception system that allows\n",
      "to identify **entities** of interest based on observed motion from various\n",
      "channels. These channels may consist of rgb image sequences obtained from\n",
      "an ordinary camera feed, depth information from stereo reconstruction or\n",
      "laser scanners, or even end effector trajectories such as the tip of a robot\n",
      "arm that manipulates an object. The restriction we set to these channels is that\n",
      "they allow us to extract motion in terms of point trajectories over time. Since\n",
      "it can not be assured that measurement updates arise with a common frequency for\n",
      "every channel, we define a feature trajectory $f_i$ as\n",

      "Given this motion we now want to create hypotheses about trajectory combinations\n",

      "##Challenges\n",
      "Using trajectories is a simplification of the multiple extended object tracking\n",
      "problem as such that solving the measurement correspondences and therefore the\n",
      "motion in each channel is performed independently of the object estimation\n",

      "the problem in a more integrated manner, this approach quickly becomes\n",

      "\n",
      "* at a certain time interval multiple trajectories can share the same path,\n",
      "  although they actually originate from different objects. *Example:*\n",
      "  someone puts a mug on a table. At first the person's hand and the mug are\n",
      "  attached to each other and move along the same path.\n",
      "  When the mug is released, it should become clear\n",
      "  that the trajectories did not originate from a single object.\n",
      "* trajectories may suddenly stop to receive updates, although the causing\n",
      "  object can still be within the observation space (eg. FOV of the camera).\n",
      "  This means the object could be partially or fully occluded and might\n",
      "  reappear at one point later.\n",
      "  Another possibility is that the object indeed left the observation area\n",
      "  which can be treated as an object *death*. We\n",
      "  should address both cases separatly.\n",
      "  This however requires to be able to recover a lost trajectory.\n",
      "  I'm not sure if this should be part of the motion estimation (tracker) or the\n",
      "  object estimation level.\n",
      "* as trajectories disappear, they may as well spawn regularly. This can\n",
      "  happen due to new objects entering the observation space (e.g. object *birth*)\n",
      "  or new parts of existing objects become visible.\n",
      "* different channels do not run with the same frequency. Hence trajectories\n",
      "  get updated asychronously.\n",
      "* trajectory may become erroneous as such that they suddenly describe\n",
      "  the path of a different object as they did earlier. This states the problem that\n",

      "the variance of the distance measure as an indicator\n",
